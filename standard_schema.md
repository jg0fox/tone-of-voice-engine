# Tone of Voice Content Standard Schema v2.0

## Purpose
This schema defines the structure for tone-of-voice content standards generated by the Tone Engine tool. Version 2.0 introduces granular sub-dimension tracking and eliminates redundancy while adding specificity.

---

## 1. Metadata
```yaml
id: [STANDARD_ID]                     # Format: TONE-XXX (e.g., TONE-347)
type: tone_voice                      # Standard type
spectrum: [SPECTRUM_NAME]             # e.g., playful-serious, casual-formal
position: [0-100]                     # Numerical position on spectrum (e.g., 76)
level: [SCOPE_LEVEL]                  # Global, Product, Team, Feature
owner: [OWNER_TEAM]                   # Team responsible for standard
version: 2.0                          # Schema version (always 2.0 for this format)
created: [YYYY-MM-DD]                 # Creation date
last_updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]            # Last modification
related_standards: []                 # Array of related standard IDs
```

## 2. Context
- **Domain**: [APPLICATION_AREA] (e.g., UX content, Marketing, Documentation)
- **Content types**: [SPECIFIC_TYPES] (e.g., Interface text, notifications, error messages)
- **Target audience**: [AUDIENCE] (e.g., End users, Internal teams)
- **Channel**: [MEDIUM] (e.g., Web interface, Mobile app, Email)
- **Scope boundaries**: [WHAT'S_INCLUDED_EXCLUDED]

---

## 3. Tone Configuration

### 3.1 Primary Positioning
- **Spectrum**: [SPECTRUM_NAME] (e.g., "Playful vs. Serious")
- **Position**: [VALUE] out of 100 ([INTENSITY] [DIRECTION])
  - Example: "76 out of 100 (Moderately Serious)"
- **Rationale**: [WHY_THIS_POSITION] (Business context, brand alignment, user needs)

### 3.2 Sub-Dimension Breakdown

Document each of the 4 sub-dimensions with granular detail. Each spectrum has 4 unique sub-dimensions that contribute to the overall tone positioning.

**Example for "Playful vs. Serious" at position 76:**
- Language flow: Moderately Rigid
- Energy level: Moderately Earnest
- Rhythmic Quality: Moderately Measured
- Creative Expression: Moderately Conventional

#### Sub-Dimension: [NAME]
- **Spectrum**: [LEFT_LABEL] ← → [RIGHT_LABEL]
- **Positioning**: [INTENSITY] [DIRECTION]
  - Example: "Moderately Rigid" or "Slightly Fluid"
- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
  1. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
  2. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
  3. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality

  1. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
  2. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
  3. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
- **Manifestation**: Content [dimension name] demonstrates [intensity] [direction] characteristics through [primary device]

#### Sub-Dimension: [NAME]
- **Spectrum**: [LEFT_LABEL] ← → [RIGHT_LABEL]
- **Positioning**: [INTENSITY] [DIRECTION]
- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
  1. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
  2. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
  3. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
- **Manifestation**: Content [dimension name] demonstrates [intensity] [direction] characteristics through [primary device]

#### Sub-Dimension: [NAME]
- **Spectrum**: [LEFT_LABEL] ← → [RIGHT_LABEL]
- **Positioning**: [INTENSITY] [DIRECTION]
- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
  1. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
  2. **[Device Name]**: Apply in [dimension name] to achieve [quality] quality
