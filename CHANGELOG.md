# Tone of Voice Engine - Changelog

## Version 2.0 - Released 2025-10-29

### Major Enhancement: Granular Sub-Dimension Tracking

This release transforms the content standard generation system to provide granular, actionable detail that matches the configurability of the tone positioning tool itself.

---

## What's New

### 1. Sub-Dimension Breakdown (Section 3.2)
Each generated standard now includes detailed breakdowns for all 4 sub-dimensions:

**Example: "Playful vs. Serious" at position 76**
- **Language flow**: Moderately Rigid
- **Energy level**: Moderately Earnest
- **Rhythmic Quality**: Moderately Measured
- **Creative Expression**: Moderately Conventional

Each sub-dimension now shows:
- Specific positioning (e.g., "Moderately Rigid")
- 3-5 active devices with application guidance
- Manifestation statement explaining how it appears in content

### 2. Anti-Patterns Section (Section 4.3)
Generated standards now explicitly list devices to **avoid** from the opposite end of the spectrum, with explanations of why they conflict with the target positioning.

Example:
- ❌ **Exclamation points**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing lighthearted characteristics
- ❌ **Creative wordplay**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing imaginative characteristics

### 3. Enhanced Device Guidance (Section 4.1)
Primary devices now include:
- **Definition**: What the device is
- **Application**: How to use it
- **Example**: Concrete example text

### 4. Sub-Dimension Matrix (Section 6)
Quick-reference table showing all sub-dimensions at a glance:

| Sub-Dimension | Position | Key Devices | How It Appears |
|---------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Language flow | Moderately Rigid | Formal punctuation, Complete sentences, Structured syntax | Moderately rigid quality in language flow |
| Energy level | Moderately Earnest | Measured tone, Factual statements, Professional language | Moderately earnest quality in energy level |

### 5. Enhanced Validation Rules (Section 7.1)
Validation rules now track each sub-dimension independently with:
- Target stance for each sub-dimension
- Required devices per sub-dimension
- Minimum device count thresholds
- Anti-pattern detection

### 6. Improved Examples (Section 5)
Examples now include "Why it works" explanations that explicitly reference the devices and positioning being demonstrated.

## What's Removed

### Eliminated Redundancy
- Position no longer repeated in multiple sections
- Consolidated tone characteristics into rationale statement
- Removed generic tone descriptions in favor of specific sub-dimension detail

---

## Files Updated

1. **Tone_tool.html**
   - Completely rewrote `generateContentStandard()` function
   - Added 15+ new helper functions for sub-dimension tracking
   - Enhanced device categorization and guidance
   - Added anti-pattern generation

2. **standard_schema.md**
   - Updated to v2.0.1 with precise format specifications
   - Added concrete examples of sub-dimension positioning
   - Clarified output structure for all sections
   - Updated footer format

3. **New Files**
   - `Tone_standard_v2_example.md` - Full example of generated output
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

## Technical Implementation

### New Helper Functions

**Positioning & Configuration:**
- `getPositioningDetails(value)` - Returns intensity and direction
- `getSubDimensionPositioning(value)` - Gets sub-dimension stance
- `generateSubDimensionBreakdown()` - Creates detailed breakdowns
- `getAllActiveDevicesWithCategories()` - Organizes devices by dimension

**Guidance Generation:**
- `generatePrimaryDevicesSection(devices)` - Creates device documentation
- `getAntiPatterns()` - Lists conflicting devices from opposite spectrum
- `getSentenceStructureGuidance()` - Position-specific structural rules
- `getPunctuationGuidance()` - Position-specific punctuation rules
- `getWordChoiceGuidance()` - Position-specific vocabulary guidance
- `getRhythmGuidance()` - Position-specific pacing guidance

**Validation & Matrix:**
- `generateSubDimensionMatrix()` - Creates quick-reference table
- `generateSubDimensionValidation()` - Builds JSON validation rules
- `generateIncorrectWithCorrections()` - Shows before/after examples

---

## Impact

### Before v2.0
Standards were high-level with generic guidance:
- "Content should maintain a moderately serious approach"
- Position stated 3-4 times throughout document
- Generic device lists without application context
- No anti-pattern guidance

### After v2.0
Standards are granular and actionable:
- "Language flow: Moderately Rigid through formal punctuation, complete sentences, structured syntax"
- Position stated once with sub-dimension detail
- Device-specific guidance with definitions and examples
- Explicit anti-patterns with conflict explanations
- Quick-reference matrix for all 4 sub-dimensions

---

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Test the tool**: Generate standards at different slider positions to see sub-dimension variation
2. **Review generated standards**: Compare v1.0 output (Tone_standard.md) with v2.0 output (Tone_standard_v2_example.md)
3. **Customize device examples**: Update `getDeviceExample()` function with project-specific examples
4. **Extend validation**: Add automated checks that verify sub-dimension adherence

---

## Technical Notes

- All generated standards now use schema v2.0 format
- Backward compatibility with v1.0 is not maintained (by design)
- Sub-dimension positioning uses 6-point granularity scale (Strongly, Moderately, Slightly)
- Anti-patterns automatically generated from opposite spectrum devices
- Device count configurable per sub-dimension (currently 3 devices shown, 2 minimum required)
