# Finding Rhythm in Your Tone of Voice - Video Script

---

Hey, so I built this experimental tool and I'd love to tell you about it and get your feedback.

It started with a question I kept running into: how do we talk about tone of voice in a way that's actually useful? Because most tone of voice frameworks live in slide decks or style guides, and they say things like "be warm and approachable" or "sound professional but friendly." Which, sure. But what does that actually *mean* when you're sitting down to write?

So I started thinking about what it would look like to break tone down into its component parts. Not just the high-level descriptors, but the actual linguistic devices that create those effects. Things like contractions, sentence rhythm, punctuation style, the use of metaphors or wordplay. The mechanics underneath the feeling.

And here's where AI came in. Because I'm not a developer, but I had this idea for an interactive tool. Something where you could move a slider on a tone spectrum and see which specific devices correspond to that positioning. So I worked with Claude to prototype it.

Now, look—this is rough. It's far from perfect or final. But what's interesting to me is the *process* of experimenting with AI assistance to explore new ways of thinking about content design work. Because suddenly, you can sketch out an idea, iterate on it quickly, and actually see it working in front of you.

The tool maps five tone spectrums—things like Playful versus Serious, Casual versus Formal. And for each position on the spectrum, it shows you a list of devices. Click on any device and you get examples and UX context. And once you've dialed in your positioning, you can generate a content standard. Like, an actual markdown document with validation rules and implementation guidelines.

The idea is that this could be a starting point for teams who want to get more specific about tone. Or for folks working with AI writing tools who need a way to define and document their standards in a format that's actually usable.

But here's the thing—I'm curious what you think. Is this useful? Is it overcomplicating something that should be simple? Are there better ways to think about this? Because what excites me isn't necessarily this exact tool, it's the idea that we can experiment with new approaches to the frameworks and processes we use every day.

AI assistance makes that kind of rapid prototyping possible. You can go from "I wonder if..." to "here's a working version" in a way that wasn't really accessible before. And I think that opens up interesting possibilities for content designers to build their own tools, explore new methods, and share experiments with each other.

So yeah, I'd love to hear what you think. Is this something worth developing further? What would make it more useful? And what are *you* curious about building?

That's all I've got for now. See you next time!
