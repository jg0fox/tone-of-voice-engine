## 3. Tone Configuration

### 3.1 Primary Positioning
- **Spectrum**: Playful vs. Serious
- **Position**: 76 out of 100 (Moderately Serious)
- **Rationale**: This positioning creates professional content that emphasizes reliability and competence that aligns with user needs and brand voice requirements for ux content.

### 3.2 Sub-Dimension Breakdown

#### Sub-Dimension: Language flow
- **Spectrum**: Fluid ← → Rigid
- **Positioning**: Moderately Rigid
- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
  1. **Formal punctuation**: Apply in language flow to achieve rigid quality
  2. **Complete sentences**: Apply in language flow to achieve rigid quality
  3. **Structured syntax**: Apply in language flow to achieve rigid quality
- **Manifestation**: Content language flow demonstrates moderately rigid characteristics through formal punctuation

#### Sub-Dimension: Energy level
- **Spectrum**: Lighthearted ← → Earnest
- **Positioning**: Moderately Earnest
- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
  1. **Measured tone**: Apply in energy level to achieve earnest quality
  2. **Factual statements**: Apply in energy level to achieve earnest quality
  3. **Professional language**: Apply in energy level to achieve earnest quality
- **Manifestation**: Content energy level demonstrates moderately earnest characteristics through measured tone

#### Sub-Dimension: Rhythmic Quality
- **Spectrum**: Bouncy ← → Measured
- **Positioning**: Moderately Measured
- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
  1. **Consistent rhythm**: Apply in rhythmic quality to achieve measured quality
  2. **Longer sentences**: Apply in rhythmic quality to achieve measured quality
  3. **Steady tempo**: Apply in rhythmic quality to achieve measured quality
- **Manifestation**: Content rhythmic quality demonstrates moderately measured characteristics through consistent rhythm

#### Sub-Dimension: Creative Expression
- **Spectrum**: Imaginative ← → Conventional
- **Positioning**: Moderately Conventional
- **Active Devices** (3-5 specific techniques):
  1. **Standard metaphors**: Apply in creative expression to achieve conventional quality
  2. **Conventional language**: Apply in creative expression to achieve conventional quality
  3. **Expected comparisons**: Apply in creative expression to achieve conventional quality

## 4. Linguistic Guidance

### 4.1 Primary Devices (DO Use)

**Measured tone**
- **Definition**: A linguistic technique in energy level that creates specific tonal effects
- **Application**: Use measured tone in your content to reinforce the desired tone positioning
- **Example**: "We recommend the following approach."

**Factual statements**
- **Definition**: A linguistic technique in energy level that creates specific tonal effects
- **Application**: Use factual statements in your content to reinforce the desired tone positioning
- **Example**: "Example text demonstrating this device"

**Consistent rhythm**
- **Definition**: A linguistic technique in rhythmic quality that creates specific tonal effects
- **Application**: Use consistent rhythm in your content to reinforce the desired tone positioning
- **Example**: "Follow these steps. Review the options. Make your selection."

**Longer sentences**
- **Definition**: A linguistic technique in rhythmic quality that creates specific tonal effects
- **Application**: Use longer sentences in your content to reinforce the desired tone positioning
- **Example**: "Example text demonstrating this device"

**Standard metaphors**
- **Definition**: A linguistic technique in creative expression that creates specific tonal effects
- **Application**: Use standard metaphors in your content to reinforce the desired tone positioning
- **Example**: "Example text demonstrating this device"

**Conventional language**
- **Definition**: A linguistic technique in creative expression that creates specific tonal effects
- **Application**: Use conventional language in your content to reinforce the desired tone positioning
- **Example**: "Example text demonstrating this device"

**Formal punctuation**
- **Definition**: A linguistic technique in language flow that creates specific tonal effects
- **Application**: Use formal punctuation in your content to reinforce the desired tone positioning
- **Example**: "Please proceed."

**Complete sentences**
- **Definition**: A linguistic technique in language flow that creates specific tonal effects
- **Application**: Use complete sentences in your content to reinforce the desired tone positioning
- **Example**: "Your request has been received."

### 4.2 Secondary Devices (Use Sparingly)

- Modal verbs: Use occasionally to soften directives
- Rhetorical questions: Use sparingly for engagement
- Transitional phrases: Use when connecting complex ideas

### 4.3 Avoid (Anti-Patterns)

- ❌ **Assonance**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing fluid characteristics
- ❌ **Consonance**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing fluid characteristics
- ❌ **Exclamation points**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing lighthearted characteristics
- ❌ **Informal interjections**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing lighthearted characteristics
- ❌ **Varied sentence length**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing bouncy characteristics
- ❌ **Staccato rhythm**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing bouncy characteristics
- ❌ **Unique metaphors**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing imaginative characteristics
- ❌ **Creative wordplay**: Conflicts with moderately serious positioning by introducing imaginative characteristics

### 4.4 Content Patterns

**Sentence structure**: Complete sentences, consistent structure, grammatically precise
**Punctuation preferences**: Formal punctuation (periods, commas, semicolons), minimal exclamation
**Word choice principles**: Professional terminology, no contractions, precise vocabulary
**Rhythm/Pacing**: Measured tempo, consistent rhythm, deliberate pacing

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 Correct Usage

#### Interface Labels
```
Context: Primary navigation and action buttons
- "Please complete your account setup."
- "Your progress has been recorded."
- "An error has occurred. Please contact support for assistance."
Why it works: Demonstrates moderately serious positioning through appropriate device usage
```

#### Notifications
```
Context: System messages and status updates
- "File upload completed successfully"
- "Session will expire in 5 minutes"
Why it works: Maintains consistency with moderately serious tone across all touchpoints
```

#### Error Messages
```
Context: Input validation and system errors
Example: "An error occurred. Please verify your input and try again."
Why it works: Uses formal language and complete sentences
Why it works: Balances serious characteristics with user needs
```

### 5.2 Incorrect Usage with Corrections

```
❌ Incorrect: "Yay! We totally got your request!"
Why it fails: Too casual - exclamation and informal language conflict with professional positioning
✓ Correct: "Your request has been received."
How it's fixed: Applied formal punctuation, complete sentence, professional language
```

```
❌ Incorrect: "Oopsie! Something went a bit wonky."
Why it fails: Playful language undermines serious, professional tone
✓ Correct: "An error occurred. Please contact support for assistance."
How it's fixed: Used precise language, formal structure, professional terminology
```
